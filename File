"#01750","Hello!"
,"Chief sidekick, <name>, at your service! I offer assistance to all the heroes here."
,"This town's been levelled to the ground by our archenemies, the dreadful Evilcorp. So, let's fix this place up and get back at them!"
,"First, let's build somewhere for your new hero to live."
,"OK, now tap the Shop menu."
"#01751","It seems we are going to need a little help from our friends..."
,"Let's build a<co=366092> <co=0070c0>new building</co> and have a friend move in."
"#01752","Tap the Construct tab."
"#01753","Right, to get started..."
,"How about a cozy little tent?"
,"I suggest building it <co=0070c0>along the highway</co>."
"#01754","Oh look!"
,"A new hero has come to visit already!"
"#01755","Hi!"
,"I just got my hero license today. Leave the protection of the town's peace to me!"
"#01756","What a peppy hero! I'm sure we can expect great things from them."
"#01757","Hi...<br>I'm the <name>, I used to be this town's protector."
,"Evilcorp attacked the town, and when I saw they had brought a massive pile of dynamite with them I heromorphed, but..."
,"...the base blew up.<br>What's more, I got swept up in the blast and that's how I got all these injuries."
,"Also the commander has been kidnapped by Evilcorp! Please rescue him!"
"#01758","My my my... It seems a new hero has come to town..."
,"We will drive them from our lands!"
"#01759","*huff huff* Help meeeeee!"
"#01760","Oh no! Evilcorp has heard about our new hero and has come to attack!"
,"Let's rescue the commander and squash Evilcorp at the same time!"
,"I guess for now... I'll come along and help you out."
,"Go to the <co=0070c0>Battle menu</co> to start the fight."
"#01761","By the way..."
,"You're leading this attack... So, what's your team name?"
"#01762","Your first battle is over, well done."
,"To be able to fight the bad guys off straight away... that's quite a talent!"
"#01763","Thank you for saving me!"
,"You did really well...<br>Battles have been really difficult recently with just us fighting..."
,"It will never be thanks enough, but here, take this building and some gold."
,"If you construct more buildings, even more heroes will join us."
"#01764","Oh, did you know you can check on your hero rewards from HQ?"
,"I've heard they come with free coins..."
,"Tap Menu and go to Achievements to claim your rewards."
"#01765","Select your reward and claim your coins."
,"When you've got lots of rewards, the Claim All option is very useful."
"#01766","So, let's keep fighting evil in the name of justice!"
"#01767","Thanks to your new building, a hero might want to come and live here."
,"Perhaps if we get to know somebody, then we could get them to move in..."
,"But for now, let's just use a Character Ticket and create our own hero."
"#01768","Whoa! It's getting quite busy around here!"
,"Oh... but we don’t have enough heromorph suits for everybody..."
,"How about playing the lottery? You can win heromorph suits there, you know."
,"Open the Shop menu and tap Suit Lottery."
,"I got enough coins for one go from a hero who used to work here before."
"#01769","So let's try our luck on the <co=0070c0>Special Lottery</co>!"
"#01770","Ooooooh, you got a good one!"
,"Equip the new heromorph suit from the Residents menu."
"#01771","Aaah, the weather's nice today..."
,"On a day like this isn’t it just perfect to farm a field and be in harmony with nature..."
,"W-w-what!?"
,"W-who's that!? They're destroying our fields!"
,"No! You can't do that! Put me down! Put me doooooown!"
,"Ahhh, heeeeeelp!"
"#01772","Heh heh heh...  Oops, I did a bad thing again..."
,"Perhaps the new hero will appear and try to stop me..."
,"That's the only way you'll ever see them again!"
"#01773","We've received new information from HQ!"
,"Let's get our new battle team together, and go smash Evilcorp into oblivion!"
"#01774","I don’t know what would have happened to me if you hadn't appeared..."
,"Oh thank you so much for rescuing me!"
,"Please take this field as a token of my gratitude... You can use it to grow crops."
"#01775","You just got a field!"
,"You can plant all the seeds you've got from your previous battles there."
,"So, let's <co=0070c0>build a field</co>!"
"#01776","Open the Construction tab."
"#01777","OK! Now select Environment on the top left..."
,"...and choose the field."
"#01778","Oooh, it looks like your field is ready!"
,"If you plant seeds here, you'll be able to harvest lots of lovely vegetables."
,"When you see the <co=0070c0>hoe</co> icon appear over the field, tap it to plant seeds."
"#01779","Let's grow some tomatoes!"
,"<co=0070c0>Tap the tomato </co>and it'll start growing."
"#01780","So, they're planted. Your seeds are growing!"
,"It's taking quite a long time... I guess we just have to wait, maybe I'll have a cup of tea..."
,"Oh! Wait! I've got this for you! Please take it, I use them all the time."
,"It shortens the time it takes until you can harvest your crops."
"#01781","So, tap Speed Up and harvest some vegetables."
"#01782","Whoa! Look at those juicy tomatoes!"
,"<co=0070c0>Tap the tomatoes </co>and harvest your crops right away."
,"That's right, get them all in one bold move."
"#01783","Now use some of your harvest to make products for sale. They will attract customers into the town and earn you money."
,"So, tap the building with a pan icon over it."
"#01784","Now let's use those tomatoes... to create a new product!"
,"I think a special vegetable juice made by heroes is sure to attract customers."
,"So, choose the<co=366092> <co=0070c0>vegetable juice</co>."
"#01785","When the product is ready, I'm sure it'll sell well!"
,"And something tells me more heroes will come to our town if we have money."
,"Well, let's strike while the iron is hot... Tap the Speed Up icon!"
"#01786","Oooh, that <co=0070c0>vegetable juice</co> is making my mouth water!"
,"With a great product like this, we can go ahead and invite a customer."
,"OK! I've got permission from HQ to invite people to our town. So, tap <co=0070c0>Invite</co>."
"#01787","Ohoho, I heard that this town is starting to make a comeback by making new products..."
,"Look! A customer has come to our town! Wahoo!"
,"Perhaps you will make friends with heroes from distant lands!"
,"Keep up the good work so that we can invite lots more heroes."
"#01788","Ooh, the vegetable juice has been bought!"
,"Finally, our first sale!"
,"Tap the screen to collect your gold."
"#01789","Hello?"
,"Oh, we have a meeting today?"
,"I see... Well, I'm sorry but I'm currently busy being kidnapped by Evilcorp, so I won't be able to attend..."
,"...Heeeeeelp!"
"#01790","Ah."
,"I arranged for an item seller to come and set up a shop here in preparation for future battles, but..."
,"...it doesn't seem like the merchant has arrived. I'll call him."
,"Beep beep beep boop."
,"Ring ring... Ring ring..."
"#01791","Oh no! It seems he's in real trouble!"
,"Let's go save him with the help of our<co=366092> <co=0070c0>hero buddies</co>!"
"#01792","You've saved me! I guess that's why they call you heroes!"
,"Well I'm going to set up shop and sell you <co=0070c0>super useful item<co=366092>s</co>!"
,"Please call in for a visit!"
,"Oh, I almost forgot! There was a robot who got captured along with me. He's going to set up a shop too!"
"#01793","Heh heh heh... Greetings..."
,"I'm going to prepare some <co=0070c0>special products<co=366092> </co>for you to... peruse. Make sure you visit... Heh heh..."
"#01794","You can visit the merchants from the Shop menu whenever you want."
,"Oh and don't forget this! It's just a little gift from the merchant for rescuing him."
,"Here you go!"
"#01795","Friends, residents, heroes... lend me your ears!"
,"Since the fateful day when we were first asked for our help, we've been repairing our secret base..."
,"But now... finally... it's almost finished!"
,"And it's all thanks to you--"
,"W-what! Who dares interrupt this momentous occasion!?"
"#01796","My my my... your little base is all fixed up, is it now?"
,"You'll never complete it! I won't allow it!"
"#01797","Hehehe..."
,"This secret base will be indispensable to you heroes from now on..."
,"Defeat these new enemies, whatever it takes!"
"#01798","We did it! Thanks to you..."
,"...the repairs on the secret base are finally finished!"
,"I'm sure now your battle team will keep getting stronger and stronger."
"#01799","I know the base has literally just been built, but let's <co=0070c0>upgrade a heromorph suit</co>!"
,"With all the available facilities at the secret base, upgrading suits is easy."
,"First, open the Base menu."
"#01800","Then tap Research."
"#01801","Now, choose a heromorph suit to upgrade!"
"#01802","You can use the crops, fish, and ore you get from the town to upgrade your heromorph suits."
,"Oh look, the previous commander has sent us some vegetables..."
,"Let's use them to upgrade something!"
"#01803","Friends, residents, heroes... lend me your ears!"
,"It's time you learned about <co=0070c0>commands</co>, a helpful solution for difficult battles."
,"Your chief sidekick knows all about them. She'll explain it to you."
"#01804","So, we can now make use of commands!"
,"You can set your commands from the <co=0070c0>Base menu</co>."
"#01805","Right you've got Recovery set."
,"Be sure to make use of your new <co=0070c0>help command<co=366092> </co>to gain an advantage in battle."
"#01806","Friends, residents, heroes... A help command has been set! Hurray!"
,"But, I've not seen the<co=366092> <co=0070c0>professor<co=366092> </co>who works at the secret base for a while..."
,"Has anybody else seen him?"
,"..."
,"Ring ring... Ring ring..."
,"Oh, I've got to take this..."
"#01807","Hello?"
,"You know the national croquet tournament I went to..."
,"Well, it was a<co=0070c0> fake event </co>organized by Evilcorp!"
,"I was fooled by their smooth talking, and now I'm trapped in a prison!"
,"Help meeeeee!"
"#01808","Ohohohohoho, I suppose I owe you for saving me."
,"You are going to be amazed when I show you the full extent of my skills."
,"Well now, you know where to find me."
"#01809","The time has come for me to get a new job..."
,"How great is that!"
,"Especially since you don’t seem to need my help on the ground any more..."
,"But, I will continue to support you... via the means of paperwork."
,"As leader, it's your job to lead this town back to its former glory!"
"#01810","Oh my gosh...  now that's a big opponent to tackle..."
,"Luckily, I made a <co=0070c0>Megabot</co> before I got captured!"
,"When battling a megamorphed foe like this one, you'll be able to fight as long as you have energy."
,"...Oh!"
,"Don't forget to build a <co=0070c0>Megabot Base</co> in town!"
"#01811","Ohohoho! Just look at that wondrous Megabot Base."
,"For the time being you can just use this lovely Megabot I made earlier."
,"If you want a different one, why not try your luck on the Megabot lottery?"
,"For more information, check the <co=0070c0>base's help commands</co>."
"#01812","Friends, residents, heroes! Our local heroes have been making a short job of any foes by teaming up with friends. Well done!"
,"And now a <co=0070c0>new request</co> for you has come through."
,"It's from a nearby region where quite a lot of baddies have appeared. Cooperation with friends in battle is the key to victory!"
,"So, pick your battle and throw down the gauntlet with a little<co=0070c0> help from your friends</co>."
,"I'll be waiting to see how you do!"
"#01813","SOS...<br>SOS..."
,"This must be to do with that construction that's going on nearby."
,"Today I was merrily walking to work when a banana just dropped on the ground in front of me! I stopped to eat it and..."
,"...I was captured!"
,"It's Evilcorp's doing! Please, help me!"
"#01814","A distress signal has arrived. Go, heroes!"
"#01815","Thanks for saving me! Om nom nom nom!"
,"The <co=0070c0>forest around your town</co> has caught my eye. I've been thinking…"
,"If you cleared it you could build a bigger town."
,"I'll introduce you to a construction company that's having financial difficulties. Om nom nom..."
"#01816","Ohohoho. Well, well, well..."
,"Yesterday I was sitting around thinking about helping with town development, and ended up setting up a <co=0070c0>company</co>."
,"I suggest you acquire this company right away and incorporate its <co=0070c0>existing technologies</co>."
,"When you acquire a new company, you'll discover new things too."
,"Let's expand our borders."
,"I'll wait at the<co=0070c0> base</co>. Try choosing it from the menu."
"#01817","Go to Research. The professor's waiting for you."
"#01818","Welcome back."
,"Choose Company Takeover and enter a<co=0070c0> bidding war<co=366092>."
"#01819","I used to be a stock broker, so let me tell you how a bidding war works."
,"You need to buy over<co=0070c0> 50% of a company</co>... and then you win! That's it!"
,"When the war's on, tap the <co=0070c0>buy icons at the bottom of the screen<co=366092> </co>to buy stock."
,"And if you get in trouble, tap Takeover Skills. They can help you get out of a tight spot."
,"War is hell, bidding wars are worse... Good luck!"
"#01820","Keep acquiring new companies and the grounds will expand, giving you more freedom to build a great metropolis."
,"If only I hadn't been captured by Evilcorp like the others, I'd help with town building too..."
,"..."
,"Wait, why am I not panicking? HELP MEEE!"
"#01821","Thanks for rescuing me!"
,"...What's that? You've got some <co=0070c0>fish eggs</co>?"
,"If you want to hatch those eggs, you'll need a <co=0070c0>Fish Farm</co>. Luckily, I have one right here in my pocket!"
,"To build it, go to Construction and find it in the Environment tab."
"#01822","Howdy doody! I work at a nearby cafeteria."
,"I went to do a delivery today, but the customer turned out to be... Evilcorp!"
,"They paid me a lot, but that's no good because now I've been captured!"
,"Somebody, anybody, help meeeeee!"
"#01823","Mucho thanko for saving me!"
,"I've been looking for a place to set up a new cafeteria but then Evilcorp abducted me."
,"Since being rescued and seeing a hero up close, I've decided to return to high school and learn to be a hero myself!"
,"I won't be needing this anymore, so you can have it."
"#01824","Hello, I was lured out of my cafe by some bad guys with a mouth-wateringly moist cake..."
,"...and I got captured by Evilcorp! Worst of all, the cake wasn't even real! Noooooo!"
,"H-help me!"
"#01825","You saved me! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
,"Here, take this building, you deserve it. I'm sure it'll be useful to the town!"
"#01826","Hello! I've been hearing rumors of your achievements for a little while now."
,"I heard you fought a lion and a bear at the same time with your bare hands, and that you can walk doing a handstand for 10 miles..."
,"Please use your power now..."
,"...and save meeeeeeeee!"
"#01827","H-h-heeelp! I'm being chased by some bad guys! They look real bad!"
,"Nooo they've caught me! I thought I'd gotten away! Heeeeeelp!"
"#01828","Help! Some people are selling suspicious stuff pretending it's delicious bread."
,"They are making so much money! Help, help, help, heeeeeelp!"
"#01829","Help me! Evilcorp has taken over my noodle shop!"
,"They're demanding I put more meat in my roast pork noodles for the same price!"
,"Heeeeeeeeelp!"
"#01830","Greetings. Evilcorp has finally descended on my town..."
,"...and they're dredging the river! H-help, please help!"
"#01831","Hey! I've been hearing a lot of good stuff about you."
,"So, today I sent out a distress signal hoping for help."
,"I've been captured for almost 2 years now, so it'd be nice if you could save me... and soon!"
"#01832","Good day! I'm the town doctor."
,"I've been captured by some villains disguised as patients. I need to escape, as real patients are waiting for me!"
,"Please, save me... and hurry!"
"#01833","Heh heh heh. I'm a famous movie director. Everybody in the business knows me."
,"We were filming a new flick and the villains were strangely realistic... then they turned out to be villains for real!"
,"They've captured me and are making a film where evil wins! Help!"
"#01834","Teehee. My wish came true at last."
,"I got kidnapped by some baddies! Now I finally feel like a real princess."
,"So, come and save me!"
"#01835","Why, hello there.<br>I accidently entered the wrong building when going to a meeting..."
,"...and I got captured by Evilcorp! They do have a very nice building though, for villains."
,"But I would like to leave now, so please help!"
"#01836","Hellooo!"
,"Erm, if you happen to have any time... I would be super happy if you could rescue me!"
,"Somebody, heeeeeelp!"
"#01837","Heehee! Hello!"
,"I went to lunch with a friend, but when I went home, I realized I'd forgotten my cellphone."
,"When I got back there I found out that Evilcorp had stolen it. And then they carried me off as well!"
,"Please, save meeeeee!"
"#01838","Hello! I've been closely following your adventures on TV."
,"The other day I went to a company to try and sell our new product..."
,"...but it turned out to be Evilcorp's base! Of course, now I've been captured!"
,"They've turned me and my friends into Hoverers. Help us!"
"#01839","Heheheheheheheh. I'm the head honcho of Herocorp."
,"I have heard all about your smiting hands of justice, slapping evil where it hurts. Well done, heroes."
,"I've been sending you small gifts of coins daily. Did they arrive safely?"
,"By the way, Evilcorp figured out my daily post schedule and have captured me!"
,"Heroes, help me!"
"#01840","Hello, heroes! It's nice to meet you."
,"A few days ago, a massive event was held at the hotel I manage, but..."
,"...it turned out to be organized by Evilcorp, and swathes of bad guys turned up, reveling in misdoings!"
,"I asked them to leave, as they were disturbing other guests, and thankfully, they obliged."
,"But on their way out they stuffed me into a suitcase and carried me off with them! Help!"
"#01841","Help! I accidently took a tour group to Evilcorp's super evil base!"
,"Save meeeeee!"
"#01842","Phew, thanks so much for rescuing me!"
,"Please take this as a token of my gratitude."
,"You should put it on a road."
"#01843","Knock, knock! Hello!"
,"As a door-to-door salesman, it's my job to sell off expensive items to oblivious clients. But it's an honest business!"
,"Now though, I've been approached by Evilcorp, who ordered me to sell suspicious items."
,"Please, help me!"
"#01844","You saved me! You have my undying gratitude."
,"Please take this as a thank-you gift."
,"You should install it in a building's grounds."
"#01845","Hi! Thanks so much for using the heromorph suits I invented!"
,"If you upgrade and mod your heromorph suits, they'll become stronger, you know. Always aim for the best!"
,"And that's why..."
,"I'm being threatened into making new suits for the bad guys! I already made a few..."
,"Help! Help! Help!"
"#01846","You saved me, heroes! Thank you so much!"
,"Here, I've got a present for you. It's a turret!"
,"It will shoot all enemies within range."
,"You should definitely install it!"
"#01847","Greetings. I travel all over the country doing business..."
,"...but recently wherever I go I can feel Evilcorp's menacing presence. It's really annoying!"
,"It seems even the lovely safety of the Heropolis region is being encroached on!"
,"Take action to protect peace… and save me while you're at it!"
"#01848","I'm saved! Hurray! Thank you so much!"
,"Here's a little something from me to really say thanks... I hope it will be useful in your town!"
"#01849","Hello. Is this the head office of Heropolis?"
,"Oh, it is? Well, I'd like to report that my office has been infiltrated by bad guys..."
,"They are making so much noise, chatting loudly on their phones and even playing games! It's terrible!"
,"Please, heroes. Save me from this hell!"
"#01850","STATUS REPORT!"
,"Evilcorp infantry at 12 O'clock. Attempting to advance on Bravo Alpha Sierra Echo!"
,"All allies down! I repeat, all allies down! Last remaining soldier has been taken prisoner behind enemy lines!"
,"And by last remaining soldier, I mean me! HEEEEEELP!"
"#01851","I'm saved! The battlefield awaits!"
,"Take this turret, soldier. You'll need it out there..."
,"It'll shoot at any bad guy in range!"
,"You should definitely install it!"
"#01852","REPORT FROM THE FIELD!"
,"You liberated my brothers in arms the other day! At ease, heroes, you made Heropolis proud."
,"But now you must once more venture out onto the field! I will wait in anticipation of my timely rescue."
,"Help me!"
"#01853","FREEDOM! You have my thanks, soldier."
,"To cement our union, take this cannon!"
,"It'll shoot at any bad guy in range!"
,"You should definitely install it!"
"#01854","STATUS REPORT!"
,"I await rescue in the squalid confines of Evilcorp. Hurry, heroes!"
"#01855","I am free! You have my thanks."
,"Take this barricade as a token of my gratitude."
,"What are barricades? They increase the durability of buildings making, them less likely to be destroyed."
,"It will be useful when the battle is on your doorstep, I can guarantee!"
"#01856","Hello? Hello!"
,"I love mining and diggy digging holes! Oh fiddlepicks, somehow the exit has been blocked by rocks!"
,"I can’t see clearly, but perhaps it's the doing of that nefarious Evilcorp!"
,"Help, please save me from diggy diggy doom!"
"#01857","I'm saved! Thank you so much!"
,"Huh?"
,"I see you have a sample of clay. Well, if you<co=0070c0> build a mine</co>, you'll be able to obtain all sorts of metals and minerals."
,"You can find mines in the <co=0070c0>Environment<co=366092> </co>tab of the Construction menu. Why not try building one!"
"#01858","Ouchie..."
,"I saw everybody doing so well and I got kinda swept up in it all. I tried to infiltrate Evilcorp's base and got beaten to a pulp..."
,"You know, if I hadn't sprained my ankle I would have won no problem!"
,"But that's besides the point, as I'm still captured! Help meeeeee!"
"#01859","You rescued me! Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
,"I want to give you this to show my appreciation. It's a Heromorph Belt."
,"If you use it in battle, everybody in your team will heromorph instantly."
,"Why not try it out!"
"#01860","W-whoa! You're all looking great!"
,"I'm swelling with pride at just how well you heroes are doing!"
,"Oh, I have a favor to ask of you."
,"Can you rescue me from the slimy clutches of Evilcorp? Saaaaaave meeeeee!"
"#01861","You saved me! Well, of course you did! Thanks, heroes!"
,"Here, take this item as an expression of my eternal gratitude."
"#01862","Hi, are you free to talk?"
,"I was filming a program about gourmet food at a new diner..."
,"...But Evilcorp owned the restaurant, and when the bill came, there was a compulsory service charge of 60000%!"
,"I couldn't pay it, so they captured me instead! Please save me!"
"#01863","Herolujah, I'm saved! Thank you so much!"
,"Have this item as thanks. Go on, take it!"
"#01864","Hey! I was in the middle of filming a documentary about Evilcorp..."
,"...but somehow the real Evilcorp got involved."
,"I couldn't get away! Please save me!"
"#01865","Hello!"
,"I host events and recently I was asked to organize a big one... but it turned out to be an Evilcorp staff's birthday party!"
,"I tried to end the party but they asked me to organize next year's one too, and are keeping me captive until then!"
,"C'mon! Help me!"
"#01866","*snap snap* Yeah, strike a pose! Hello!"
,"Yesterday I was out taking photographs of my favorite subject. Railroads."
,"I managed to capture conclusive proof of the location of Evilcorp's secret base. A photo of a lifetime!"
,"...But I was captured! They deleted everything apart from my precious railway photos. Help me!"
"#01867","Hello everybody, how are you doing?"
,"I'm doing fine here in captivity, thanks for asking."
,"No, actually, I'm not fine. HELP!"
"#01868","Greetings! I am a king. That's right, a real king!"
,"I came to Heropolis in absolute secrecy to buy games, but Evilcorp still managed to capture me!"
,"Absolute secrecy? More like absolute calamity..."
,"I'm a king, you must save me!"
"#01869","Hello, I'm Chimpan Z, the lab monkey. Pleased to meet you."
,"I developed some amazing heromorph suits, but apparently Evilcorp has been using them for evil deeds..."
,"I should've known there was something fishy about the generous pay in bananas that they offered."
,"I'm already fed up of working for Evilcorp. Even if they do feed me truckloads of bananas..."
,"Please rescue me from this fruity fiasco!"
"#01870","I extend my kingly greetings from my historical castle."
,"Although, recently my walls were breached, and on top of that I was taken prisoner."
,"Vassals, launch a rescue mission at once!"
,"Save your king!"
"#01871","Teeheeheehee. Why, hello there."
,"I was recently on a round-the-world cruise, when my ship was hijacked!"
,"I have no idea where I am right now, but I'm certainly enjoying the thrill."
,"I could probably escape at any time, but I would much prefer to be saved by a hero."
,"Come rescue me, sweeties! Teehee!"
"#01872","Oh wow, you saved me! Thanksies!"
"#01873","It's time for your first battle, I'm nervous..."
,"You know, in order to attack, you have to tap the <co=0070c0>Attack button on the bottom right</co>."
,"Keep tapping it until the bad guys are defeated."
"#01874","When the gauge on your hero's nameplate fills, you can <co=0070c0>heromorph</co>."
,"When an arrow appears on your hero's nameplate, <co=0070c0>swipe left</co> to heromorph and activate the power of their suit!"
,"Let's get swipin' and heromorphin'!"
"#01875","When a heromorphed hero's fighting spirit builds... that's your chance to launch a <co=0070c0>special attack</co>!"
,"When an arrow appears on a heromorphed hero's nameplate,<co=0070c0> swipe left</co> to launch the special attack."
,"Let's get swipin' and hit the bad guys hard!"
"#01876","Hero-moly! Bad guys have appeared in town!"
,"If we don't do anything they will destroy the whole town!"
,"Tap the <co=0070c0>Baddie icon</co> to start a battle."
,"Let's turn these villains into pancakes!"
"#01877","Repeated attacks have depeleted your power."
,"If you wait a little... your<co=366092> <co=0070c0>power gauge will refill</co>!"
"#01878","A hero friend is visiting your town."
,"Perhaps they are here to buy something... Let's watch them for a while and see."
"#01879","Ohohoho! What a thrilling bidding war, you did well!"
,"I'll keep looking for new companies to acquire. It would be great to get more and more and more!"
,"By the way, your budget in bidding wars will increase along with the <co=0070c0>number and type of buildings in your town</co>."
,"That means the more developed your town is, the smoother bidding wars will go..."
,"So you better get building!"
"#01880","It'd be a waste not to equip that new suit you got."
,"Choose your <co=0070c0>new hero</co>."
"#01881","<co=0070c0>Meaty chunks</co> appeared in the town."
,"Some installations can spawn meaty chunks every now and then."
,"Install more of them if your meat stocks keep running low."
"#01882","There's<co=0070c0> money</co> on the floor."
,"Some facilities can generate money every now and then."
,"Install more of them to obtain more money."
"#01883","Oh no! Your <co=0070c0>HP</co> is getting low!"
,"Tap <co=0070c0>Recovery</co> at the bottom of the screen to recover health."
"#01884","You haven't recovered your health!"
,"It's a serious risk to rush into battle with low HP. We can't afford to lose!"
,"Here, use this item to <co=0070c0>recover your HP</co>!"
"#01885","Heromorph suits each have their own <co=0070c0>weakness<co=366092> </co>and<co=366092> <co=0070c0>fortes</co>."
,"Whoa, both your heroes and the enemies are exploiting each other's weaknesses. Interesting!"
,"Oh, my suit is just a prototype, so it won't affect anything..."
,"If you want to know more about which types of suit affects what, check out the <co=0070c0>How to Play </co>guide."
,"Good luck!"
"#01886","...Huh? There's an<co=366092> <co=0070c0>indirect type opponent</co>."
,"We have direct types, so this is our chance! I think we have the <co=ff0000>advantage</co>."
,"Our crit rate has increased... and what's more, the foes' evasion rate has decreased!"
,"If you want to know more about advantages, check out the <co=0070c0>How to Play<co=366092> </co>guide."
,"Let's get out there and pummel evil into submission!"
"#01887","...Huh? There's an <co=0070c0>Aerial type opponent</co>."
,"We have some direct types, so I think this puts us at a <co=ff0000>disadvantage</co>."
,"The foes' crit rate has increased... and what's worse, our evasion rate has decreased!"
,"This is going to be a hard battle..."
,"...but we can weather this storm! Just remember to use Recovery if your HP gets low!"
"#01888","Your unity gauge is full!"
,"When all your battle team members have heromorphed, you can launch a powerful team attack."
,"Perhaps it would be useful in a boss battle, or even just when you're in a pinch."
,"Oh! Remember, you can only use this sort of attack when <co=0070c0>2 or more<co=366092> </co>of your heroes are in battle."
"#01889","It's finally time for a unity attack!"
,"Let's combine the power of your heroes and launch a devastating attack!"
"#01890","You've amassed quite a few friendship points..."
,"Oh my, you got enemy suits!"
,"You can wear them, of course..."
,"But you can also use them to upgrade your help commands and heromorph suits."
,"Let's collect loads and loads of baddies' suits!"
"#01891","You've ranked up, I see... Now you can<co=366092> <co=0070c0>upgrade help commands</co> in the Base menu."
,"But it uses up morph suits to do so..."
,"...so maybe it would be a good idea to repeat some battles and collect suits from enemies."
"#01892","Ohohoho! I see you've managed to obtain a super secret weapon blueprint!"
,"With some help from invited friends, we can use them to develop special equipment."
,"Secret weapons not only change your heroes' looks, but make them stronger too."
,"We should develop loads!"
"#01893","Friends, residents, heroes! I see your numbers have been growing!"
,"And that's why... I have received orders from HQ!"
,"They say... Ahem... <co=0070c0>Patrols may begin</co>!"
,"Send off your heroes who aren't participating in battles to contribute to the safety of the town!"
,"If they do well, I'm sure they will bring home lots of spoils!"
,"Let's send a patrol out right away from the <co=0070c0>Base menu</co>."
"#01894","Let's bury a time capsule!"
,"It takes a lot of time before they're ready to be dug up, but they may contain great treasures."
,"Let's see what it says on the side... ""<co=0070c0>Bury near an installation</co>, contents may vary."""
,"Well let's do what it says and bury it near an installation..."
"#01895","Your construction is complete..."
,"Oh look, you've built compatible installations near to each other and gained a <co=0070c0>bonus</co>!"
,"It's a good idea to consider location first when you want to build something new."
"#01896","Friends, residents, heroes! You can now herovolve a heromorph suit!"
,"When a suit reaches max level, you can herovolve it if you want to continue increasing its level."
,"But you'll need some of the baddies' suits..."
,"So, get out there and continue beating them!"
,"Herovolution is the solution!"
"#01897","Ohohoho! Your patrol team is finally ready to go. Tap Deploy to send them off."
"#01898","Pick a destination."
,"The number of destinations will increase as you clear more normal battles."
"#01899","Choose members to send on patrol by tapping Heroes."
,"Did you know, the more your heroes grow the less time patrols will take..."
"#01900","It looks like the patrol team you sent out has returned!"
"#01901","It's time to dig up that time capsule we buried!"
,"<co=0070c0>Tap the time capsule</co> on the map!"
"#01902","A friend had <myname> give them a helping hand."
,"When your friends enlist your hero to fight in their battles, you gain friend points."
,"You can use these points in the lottery."
,"Play every day and make sure to use each other's heroes to gain lots of friend points."
"#01903","Thanks to your friend, you've acquired some modification points for the suit you have equipped."
,"Modification points are important if you want to bring out the hidden stats of your suits."
,"I heard if you get a duplicate suit from the lottery, you'll get a lot of these points... Though that rarely happens."
,"Only the suit equipped to your first resident will be displayed to friends."
"#01904","A friend had <myname> give them a helping hand."
"#01905","You've amassed quite a lot of friend points."
,"Let's spend them trying our luck on the <co=0070c0>Friend Lottery</co>! You can find it in the Suit Lottery section of the Shop menu!"
"#01906","This is the normal lottery."
,"You can use your friend points here to obtain the bad guys' suits. Rarely, you can also obtain heromorph suits."
,"I heard that in the special lottery, you can obtain high-performance heromorph suits..."
,"...and also super rare ones too! We should give it a go at some point!"
"#01907","Ohohohoho! I'm ready, let's develop a secret weapon!"
,"So, what shall we develop?"
"#01908","Ohohoho! Now choose friends who you want to entrust the development to."
,"When their <co=0070c0>personalities</co> and <co=0070c0>hobbies</co> match, it speeds up development and may yield better results."
,"By the way, when your friends go home, you can't use their help any more."
,"It'd be much more efficient if you could get them to move in instead!"
,"So, who will you choose?"
"#01909","At last, the development of your secret weapon begins!"
,"Let's see what they come up with."
"#01910","Ohohohoho! That's it, the development is complete!"
,"Besides friends' <co=0070c0>personalities<co=366092> </co>and <co=0070c0>hobbies</co>, rank and hobby level also matter."
,"The higher they are, the better the secret weapons you can make."
"#01911","Terrific! The secret weapon has been made."
,"Let's pick a hero and equip it immediately!"
"#01912","Hello!"
,"This is the Login Roulette. You can spin it <co=0070c0>once every 8 hours</co>."
,"If you manage to stop it at the right time, you can get awesome prizes!"
,"So let's give it a go! Spin the wheel!"
"#01913","Cool! Did you know, the roulette wheel's prizes change every day!"
,"I guess we should come back in 8 hours."
"#01914","Oh no! The bad guys won!"
,"Perhaps we should upgrade our suits... Or try and win some strong suits on the lottery..."
,"If you choose to continue, your heroes will be resurrected at full health and you'll get more time on the timer."
,"Oh I just remembered, I won some coins on the lottery yesterday. Perfect!"
,"Let's use them to continue."
"#01915","Oh no, you were beaten in the bidding war..."
,"If you increase the number of installations in your town, your budget and funds will also increase, making bidding wars easier."
,"Your town's technology and buy-out skills also have a big effect on the outcome of bidding wars."
,"Look at installations' compability and try different set-ups to give you a technological edge."
"#01916","From now on, the battles will be different to the ones you've experienced so far."
,"Things are going to get tough, and we might need some friends by our side to help."
,"OK, let's choose<co=366092> <co=0070c0>4 friends<co=366092> </co>to battle alongside you in our hero team!"
"#01917","You used a help command."
,"Help commands use some of your meaty chunks, but don't hesitate to use them in times of need."
"#01918","You don't have enough <co=0070c0>meaty chunks</co>."
,"But I've heard about an item that can restock them instantly..."
,"But for the time being, it might be a good idea to try waiting for our town's facilities to create some."
"#01919","What!? The villain just megamorphed!"
,"The rumors are true! With sufficient evil energy, baddies can megamorph, getting more powerful!"
,"Although there's a considerable difference in size and strength, let's summon up our power and beat this thing!"
"#01920","We've intercepted information on the location of a baddies' base! Let's defeat their boss and destroy the base!"
,"The more bad guys you defeat the more of the base you'll be able to see."
,"I wonder where the boss is hiding..."
"#01921","Oh no, one of your installations has been destroyed in battle."
,"If a hero's home is destroyed, they wont be able to recover HP automatically for a little while."
,"We should defeat enemies before they damage anything."
"#01922","You're building a turret."
,"When complete, it will shoot at any enemy in range."
"#01923","Look! Your turret has shot a baddie!"
,"They will also help us out in battle. So, if we build lots of them, battles will be much easier!"
"#01924","You've obtained a new <co=0070c0>Help Command</co>."
,"You can set it in the Base menu."
"#01925","You've ranked up. Congratulations!"
,"Your friend cost limit has also increased."
,"Now you can get friends with a higher cost to help you in battle."
,"Keep battling and rank up even more!"
"#01926","The enemies you battled started to warm up to you."
,"I wonder what will happen when their friendship bars are full... Oooh, I can't wait to find out!"
"#01927","Hmm, we're facing stronger and stronger enemies."
,"Perhaps it'll soon be time to expand your<co=366092> <co=0070c0>battle team</co> too."
,"When you have more heroes, you can tailor your team to each battle."
,"The off-duty heroes can rest, recovering HP based on their houses' recovery power."
,"So, why don’t you consider <co=0070c0>expanding your battle team</co>?"
"#01928","Ohohohoho! The town is growing and there seems to be more heroes here than ever!"
,"Perhaps it'll soon be time to expand your<co=0070c0> patrol team</co>."
,"If you do, there's a better chance that your heroes will bring back upgrade materials, you know."
,"So, why don’t you consider <co=0070c0>expanding your patrol team</co>?"

"#01937","Tap an installation you find irksome or in the way and <co=ff0000>demolish</co> it."
"#01938","Tap the installation you wish to move."
"#01939","None."
"#01940","You can build this in the <co=0070c0>grounds of a building</co>."

"#01941","You can build this on the <co=0070c0>roof of a building</co>."
,"I expect it will have a good effect on the hero who lives there."
"#01942","You can build this <co=0070c0>on a road</co>."
"#01943","What <co=0070c0>personality</co> do want for your hero? It will have an effect in battle."
,"Choose whichever one you like!"
"#01944","Now pick a<co=0070c0> hobby</co>. Hobbies affect relationships with friends."
"#01945","This is a neat little feature that automates your crop fields, and product manufacturing."
,"If you want to try the hands-free approach, you have to buy an <co=0070c0>Automater</co> from the shop."
,"You should definitely go and get one."
"#01946","Uuurgh, that rock is so inconvenient and annoying..."
,"Perhaps if you rank up, you'll be able to get rid of that irritating and vexatious rock."
,"I've been racked with rock-related nightmares, so please keep working hard and get rid of it soon!"
"#01947","Oh, what's that? Could it be a <co=0070c0>rare enemy</co>?"
,"I have a strange feeling that if you defeat them, you'll get cool loot."
"#01948","Oooh, you got a hat! I love hats!"
,"Quick, let's open the <co=0070c0>Residents menu<co=366092> </co>and make somebody wear it!"
"#01949","There's no road going to that building..."
,"You should connect up the building with <co=0070c0>roads or highways</co>."
"#01950","Hey, that's an installation you have to construct in a building's grounds. I'm sure it will make your buildings much stronger."
,"Let's try and install lots and lots of these."
"#01951","Oh look. You just won a duplicate heromorph suit."
,"Now the suit's mod level has risen, and its stats have also improved."
,"Since you've obtained lots of modification points, you might be able to<co=366092> <co=0070c0>modify<co=366092> </co>a suit."

"#01953","Ouch! That looked like it hurt..."

,"I'm looking forward to the day when you start selling <co=0070c0>vegetable juice</co>. People will definitely come here and buy it!"
"#01961","You've harvested some vegetables... and discovered a new recipe."
,"Huh?"
,"It seems some people have heard rumors about our town..."
"#01962","So, let's start manufacturing products."
,"OK, so this time let's use some tomatoes to make juice. Perhaps if we make products, customers will come to visit."
,"Touch the building with the floating<co=366092> <co=0070c0>pan icon<co=366092> </co>to start manufacturing."
"#01963","Thanks for always making such amazing products! Here's a gift to show my appreciation."
"#01964","Let's get one of the <co=0070c0>friends you met before<co=366092> </co>to live here!"
"#01965","Ohohoho! It looks like your help command has reached maximum level."
,"But now, an even stronger one has been developed."
,"Maybe you should make use of it from now on."
"#01966","Ooooh! A baddie has dropped some rare loot... I wonder what in Heropolis could be inside!"
,"Did you know these drops are rumored to contain slightly different loot to the regular treasure boxes?"
,"Speaking of rare loot, I heard that if you have the Steal skill, then you might get even more of these treasure boxes!"
,"Anyway, I can't wait any longer, let's finish the battle so that we can take a look inside!"
"#01967","Well done. It's now been <1> years. This ends the first chapter of the game."
,"Your Clear Points will now be calculated."
"#01968","You have <1> total Clear Points."
,"Congratulations! You've beaten your high score!"
,"See if you can beat it on your next playthrough!"
"#01969","You have <1> total Clear Points."
,"Aww, you didn't beat your high score."
,"See if you can beat it on your next playthrough!"
"#01970","From now on, your funds will no longer count toward your high score."
,"But you can keep playing for as long as you like! Have fun!"
,"If you start the game again from the beginning, you can carry over some items and components."
"#01971","You don't have enough research points..."
"#01972","You don't have any items."
"#01973","It looks like you don’t have enough coins to do that. Perhaps you should look for some more."
"#01974","Choose your first character"
"#01975","H-help me! Please, come and save me from this evil!"
"#01976","I'll be waiting for you, heroes. Come and see our true power!"
"#01977","Heeeeelp!"
"#01978","I'm gonna pay you back for last time... with interest!"
,"Let's fight!"
"#01979","Help meeeeee!"
"#01980","Huh! You've really come all this way to lose!?"
,"Death will rain down on you from the sky!"
"#01981","Stop right there! I will never allow your base to be complete!"
"#01982","Ohohoho. Please come and save me! Heeeeeelp!"
"#01983","This is gonna be a sweet battle."
,"Because you lot look like a piece of cake!"
"#01984","Hey! Over here! Help me!"
"#01985","Heroes... come out to plaaay! How do you like having the tables turned on you!"
"#01986","Fwahahahaaa! I'm gonna use this angler as bait for a much bigger catch!"
,"If you get in my way... I'll make bait out of you too!"
"#01987","Quickly, heroes, save me!"
"#01988","How can this be? Who would've thought that the heroes from this pitiful town would make it this far?"
,"I'm gonna make you regret coming to face me!"
"#01989","Heard about free hugs? Well, I'm giving away free punches to the face!"
"#01990","Groooaaar! Me twist hero 'til hero break!"
"#01991","Well done for getting this far, heroes... It's almost a pity that I'm going to tear you to shreds!"
,"All you puny heroes will be defeated... My rocket launch is soon though, so I better destroy you quickly!"
"#01992","Blubbleubble! Evil will never lose!"
"#01993","Grohohohaah! I'm going to burn you to cinders!"
"#01994","Bwahahahaaaaaa! Has the little baby hero lost their way?"
,"You'll never leaf this place alive!"
"#01995","Beep beep beep... Heroes located. Eliminate, ELIMINATE!"
"#01996","Hahahaha... HAHAHA! You're back for more!?"
,"My evil underlings, black as the darkest night, will be forced to fight you until the bitter end!"
,"Why black you ask? Well, because they do <co=0070c0>huge damage to heroes wearing any other color</co>, of course!"
,"But on the other hand, they'll take more damage from all other colors too... Not that it matters! Now bring it!"
"#01997","Argh! Due to you pesky heroes my launch was delayed! UNFORGIVABLE!"
,"My evil underlings, yellow as the most dastardly custard, will do <co=0070c0>huge damage to blue</co> heroes!"
,"So, make my day and send your blue heroes to face me! Oh, but don't send green ones by mistake!"
"#01998","You'll never free this hostage!"
,"Haha! My evil underlings, blue as the deepest ocean, will <co=0070c0>zap red heroes into oblivion with huge damage</co>!"
,"Don't send any yellow heroes though. I wouldn't like that at all."
,"...You're never ever ever ever EVER getting this hostage back!"
"#01999","Fyehehee! Here comes my inferno punch!"
,"My evil underlings, red as the fiercest fire, burn<co=0070c0> green heroes to a crisp with huge damage</co>!"
,"So gather your green heroes and send them my way! Go on!"
"#02000","Fuhuhuhu! It's you again!"
,"My evil underlings, green as the most envious of my rivals, will do <co=0070c0>huge damage to yellow heroes</co>!"
,"But they're weak to red ones... Anyway, come forth and let us decide who is strongest!"
"#02001","Heh heh... Speak of heroes, and they will appear!"
,"I... I will never lose!"
"#02002","Now you're here, you will never escape! It's time to duel, so show me your moves!"
"#02003","Blam blam blam! Here comes the pain train!"
"#02004","Heroes... we meet at last!"
,"So, shall we dance?"
"#02005","Damn it! I was just in the middle of doing a super evil thing! How dare you interrupt me!"
"#02006","Clumpybump! I'm gonna chew you up and spit you out! YUM!"
"#02007","Shields up! Think you can beat me!?"
"#02008","Groaargh! My fist is going to dance all over your face! Snow man can beat me!"
"#02009","NYEHEHEHEEE! I'M GOING TO BURN YOU ALL!"
"#02010","There's no use turtling away, heroes... I must avenge my comrades!"
"#02011","Uuurngh! Uuuuuurngh! UUUAAARGH!"
"#02012","O-oh! It's you! How are you, old friend! It's been such a long time..."
,"Huh? What do you mean you've never met me before?"
,"D-damn you! I will punish you for causing me such shame! I demand retribution!"
"#02013","Hya! Hya! Hyaaaaaar! Ice to meet you..."
"#02014","Greetings... remember me? I burned your town to the ground  before..."
,"...But I'm not done yet, now I'm going to toast YOU!"

,"Nyeheheheheeeeee!!! I can't stop laughing! I'm going to annihilate you!"
"#02017","Bleep bloop rawr! You heroes are an infinite source of constant annoyance."
,"I'll trample you into the ground!"
"#02018","ICE AND DICE!"
"#02019","Groooar! GROOOAAAR!"
,"I'm gonna flame blast you into next year!"
"#02020","Welcome, heroes. I wanted to go and buy some ham for my sandwiches..."
,"...but it's OK."
,"I'll just make ham out of you instead!"
"#02021","Blobbleobble! What are these rigid forms that I see here before me?"
,"Hah hah hah! I'm going to deprive you of the privilege of a sturdy body!"
"#02022","M... m... m... m... MUSHROOM!"
"#02023","Snhehehee... If you think I'm going to release my hostage easily, you're wrong!"
,"Snobody's being released today!"
"#02024","Good day to you. I have heard that there is some very delicious bamboo around here."
,"However I can't seem to find any..."
,"So I think I'm going to devastate your town out of pure spite... Starting with you!"
"#02025","Zip zap zod zooop... This planet is a fine specimen indeed..."
,"Let's invade it! UFOs, descend menacingly!"
"#02026","ME NO FORGIVE! ME NO FORGIVE!"
,"Pudding gone from fridge. Eaten! Me know it was you!!!"
"#02027","Groooaaargh! I'm completely fluent in the language of crushing and trampling."
"#02028","G...G...G...Greeeyaaaaaa!"
,"GREEEYAAAAAAAAA!"
"#02029","My claws are icicles of death, honed and ready to poke you! I shall snow no mercy!"
"#02030","Zing... ziiing... ziiiiiing... I am the mysterious swordsman that has been dominating this entire region!"
,"I shall show you the full extent of my power!"
"#02031","Nyamnyamnyam... Nyaaam!"
,"Dino-smash!"
"#02032","Hello, puny morsels. I'm gonna flatten you all into hero pancakes! It's so easy being squeezy!"
,"What can I say... I have an addiction to constriction!"
"#02033","Brrr, it's been getting chilly recently hasn't it... Be careful not to catch a cold!"
,"Now, let's fight!"
"#02034","*cough cough* I'm not really up for anything today... Can we do this battle tomorrow?"
,"*cough*"
,"..."
,"Aha you've dropped your guard! Now I'll show you my bark and my bite!"
"#02035","Welcome to my domain. I'm so very pleased to finally meet the powerful heroes I've been hearing about..."
,"Now I shall defeat you, and forever be known across the whole of Heropolis as the conqueror of justice!"
"#02036","Beep beep rawr! Revenge protocols, activate!"
"#02037","Nyeheheheheheheheheee... Would you do me a favor and expose your bare neck?"
,"Nyehehehehehehehehehe... Stabby stabby sting sting!"
"#02038","Oh, it's you..."
,"Hmmm that wasn't very enthusiastic... I need more fire... more passion... Let's try that again..."
,"SALUTATIONS!!!"
,"Much better! Let's burn!"
"#02039","Thump... thump... thump..."
,"Thumpthumpthumpthump... RAAAAARH!"
"#02040","Nyamnyam... nyamnyamnyam..."
,"Nyamnyamnyam... NYAAAAAA!"
"#02041","Y-y-you! It's you, my long-lost brother!"
,"Huh? You're not?"
,"Damn it! I'm gonna knock the stuffing out of you!"
"#02042","Ex-squeeeeeeze me! I guess you are a little unfamiliar with this concept, but let me explain it to you..."
,"...Last time I was going easy on you!"
"#02043","Ergh... I totally failed in our last battle, just like I flunked my high school exams..."
,"It sucks, man..."
,"But this time I'm gonna grind you up into a nice refreshing hero slushie! I can feel it!"
"#02044","Globoloboloboloblob... ZAP!"
,"You're going to meet with a sticky yet shocking end! Globolobolobolob... ZAP ZAP!"
"#02045","Teheh heh heh heh... heh heh... I wonder for how many seconds you can resist..."
,"...my enchanting and alluring attacks!"
"#02046","C'mon, dudes. Get outta your shells more! I know, let's go traveling together..."

"#02047","Groooaaar! I see you're back to taste my flames once more!"
,"This time I will not lose!"
"#02048","Zeeheeheeheeeeee! I left the tag on my new cape and went out in public..."
,"Now I'm in an uncontainable rage! I will liquidate you with all my power!"
"#02049","ICE, ICE, HEROES..."
"#02050","Slazap! I was meant to be visiting my clutch of astro-eggs today... But I'm here instead!"
,"So, please, make this an easy battle!"
"#02051","BEEP BEEP BEEP! Fuel depleted. Full power deactivated. Please refill..."

,"OBLITERATE!"
"#02052","Zip zap zod zooop... Earthling detected! Earthling detected!"
,"Initiating human existence erasure systems..."
"#02053","I know we've only just met, but I feel like a hug will bring us much closer together."
,"You know, like family... or maybe more like cousins... OR LIKE RIVALS!"
,"Yes! Be embraced in my circle of confusion!"
"#02054","Hummm... Hummm... Hummmmmm... Heavy gauge artillery extended..."
,"FIRE!"
"#02055","Hummm... CLUNK! Hummm... CLUNK! Super mega gauge ultra artillery extended!"
,"DECIMATE THEM!"
"#02056","Uuuaaaooo! Heroes, I need something from you... It's..."
,"...your heads! C'mon, hand them over!"
"#02057","Ohohohoho... OHOHOHO! Well done getting this far!"
,"I'm going to give you a reward ..."
,"... A reward called defeat!"
"#02058","Globoloboloboloblob... ZAP! Wanna see something shocking? How about my 10000000 volts!"
"#02059","Nyehehehehehe. Please accept my apologies, dear heroes... I have kept a secret from you..."
,"Do you know what happens if you take this stabby stingy scorpion off my head?"
,"I die! So, go on, try and take it!"
"#02060","Oo0o0o0oo0o0! NO MORTAL HAS EVER ESCAPED MY DEATHLY WRATH!"
,"But fear not, heroes. I am merciful... I shall relieve you of the burden of living!"
"#02061","G-g-groooar! Flames! Ash! Cinders!"
"#02062","I was off-duty, and having a nice time stomping around my territory..."
,"...but how could I pass up the chance to trample some heroes!?"
,"It's ham time, and I like mine wafer thin!"
"#02063","Nyamnyamnyam! I will not lose again!"
"#02064","Kekekeke... Many of my fellow dragons have fallen under your blades..."
,"But I... I will boil your guts and eat them for breakfast!"
,"NOW BUUUUUURN!"
"#02065","Sss... Ssssss... SNAAAAAARG..."
"#02066","Heroes, come with me..."
,"...TO HELL!"
"#02067","Greyaaaaaa!"
,"Let's fight in a supersonic sky battle!"
"#02068","Ohohoho, I'm gonna ice you!"
"#02069","Hello, heroes. What lovely weather it is today..."
,"In fact, it's the ideal day for a battle to the death... and I've got a feeling I'm gonna win!"
"#02070","Oh yes, today is definitely gonna be the day I get hero for dinner!"
"#02071","ME! MEGATON PUNCH!"
"#02072","Zip zap zod zooop! Exterminate! Exterminate!"
"#02073","Hummmmmm... Hummmmmm... Heavy gauge artillery re-extending! FIRE, FIRE, FIIIIIIRE!"
"#02074","Hummmmmm... CLUNK! Hummmmmm... CLUNK! Super mega gauge ultra artillery shelling initiated!"
"#02075","Bzzzzzzt... A new age of war is upon us. I stand as the face of destruction!"
,"Yes, come! Meet with your doom!"
"#02076","Heh heh heh. Welcome... welcome..."
,"I want to spread my fake gyms all over Heropolis, and to do that I need to look strong..."
,"That's why I'm searching for my perfect battle partner... Now face me!"
"#02077","Heh heh heh. Hello again..."
,"I set up a business selling pretend miraculous water from the fountain of youth. It's quite profitable, so I made this..."
,"…A HUGE BATTLE MECH! Now face me!"
"#02078","Heh heh heh. We meet again..."
,"My new mail-order battle mech business has been running smoothly..."
,"...So I made this commemorative super strong jet-propelled battle mech!"
"#02079","Bzzzzzzt... CLUNK! Bzzzzzzt... CLUNK! H.E.L.L.O!"
,"L.E.T.S F.I.G.H.T!!!"
"#02080","Nyeheheheh... hehehehehe... NYEHEHEHEHEEE! So, you've made it..."
,"You've managed to defeat my whole army... Admirable, very admirable indeed."
,"But I'm afraid your journey is at an end. I, commander of villainy, master of mischief, and overlord of evil, will defeat you!"
,"I will rain diabolical destruction upon you all with all my monstrous might!"
"#02081","Noooooo! I lost!"
"#02082","Uuuaaah!  I... I... lost?"
"#02083","Uuuaaah! You beat me!?"
"#02084","Ahhh! Ow ow ow ow owww!"
"#02085","And here it ends..."
"#02086","D-darn! How could I lose!"
"#02087","I am defeated! Noooooo!"
"#02088","Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! OH NOOOOOO!"
"#02089","Verily, I have lost."
"#02090","AAAAAARGH! ME LOSE!"

"#02098","Uwaaaaaa! I will not be so lenient next time we meet!"
"#02099","Ahhh! Glory to Evilcorp!"
"#02100","Alas... My life is dangling from the fishing rod of destiny..."
,"...Oh, a bite!"
"#02101","I'm defeated!?"
,"..."
,"NOOOOOOOOO!"
"#02102","It wasn't meant to be like this..."
"#02103","Hahaha... hahahaaa! I have no more fight in me! Farewell!"
"#02104","What!? Nooooo!"
"#02105","That didn't taste so good..."
"#02106","Shields... down..."
"#02107","What a whiteout..."
"#02108","NYEHEHEHEEEEEE!"
"#02109","Ahhh! I'm shell-shocked!"
"#02110","That wasn't pharaoh..."
"#02111","I don't even know what's going on..."
,"Where am I again?"
"#02112","That wasn't very n-ice!"
"#02113","My flame has gone out..."
"#02114","Hah... See ya later, alligator..."
"#02115","Nyehehehehehe! Nicely done... Nicely done..."
"#02116","*This machine is currently out of service.*"
"#02117","Ahhh! A glacial fissure!"

"#02119","B-but I want my dinner!!!!"
"#02120","Bloorg! I was no match for rigidity..."

"#02130","I'm all wrung out... Urgh..."
"#02131","What! How did you do that!?"
"#02132","Well, that's me stumped!"
"#02133","Remember meeeeeeeee!"
"#02134","D-d-d-def... BZZZT... f-f-feated..."
"#02135","Ahhh! Could this really be how it ends..."
"#02136","There are plenty of stronger foes than me up ahead! Grahaha!"
"#02137","Nyamnyamnyam! I bit my own tail..."
"#02138","I-it was you Heropolis guys all along!"
"#02139","B-but... You were never meant to get this far!"
"#02140","Nooo! Ice couldn't even beat the likes of you!"
"#02141","Globoloboloboloblob... blob."
"#02142","Huh? Was I not bewitching enough?"
"#02143","I'm turtley defeated!?"
"#02144","GROOOAAAR!"
"#02145","Zeeheeheeheeeeee!"
"#02146","No, my glacial fissure is widening!"
"#02147","Slazap! What a waste of time!"
"#02148","....................."
"#02149","What a cruel planet!"
"#02150","Man, crash and burn or what!?"
"#02151","Artillery retracting."
"#02152","Hummmmmmmmm...."
"#02153","W-why today!"
"#02154","Ohohoho! Perhaps this is all just a bad dream..."
"#02155","Globoloboloboloblob... 10000000 volts of failure..."
"#02156","Ahhh! I need to go to the hospital and get this reattached!"
"#02157","What! You've managed to cheat even death!?"
"#02158","GROOOAAAR! I've forgotten to update my flame license!"
"#02159","RAWR! Don't forget about meeeeee!"
"#02160","Nyam! I'm outa here!"
"#02161","Nyum! You meanies!"
"#02162","Sss... Sssssss... Sssssssss..."
,"..."
,"...SNAAAAAAAAAAAARG!!!"
"#02163","It's way too hot for me here!"
"#02164","We shall meet again, heroes!"
"#02165","Ahhhhhh! I can't hold myself together anymore!"
"#02166","RAWR! At least I got defeated on a nice day..."
"#02167","Graggleaggle! But I'm soooooo hungry!"
"#02168","GROOOAAAR! WE MEET AGAIN ONE DAY!"
"#02169","Zooop... KABOOM!"
"#02170","Hummmmmmmmm... KABOOM!"
"#02171","HULL BREACH!!!"
"#02172","So this is the power of a hero..."
"#02173","Heh heh heh... I'll be back..."
"#02174","Heh heh heh... This is not yet the end..."
"#02175","Heh heh heh... We will meet again someday, heroes!"
"#02176","A.A.A.A.A.A.H! D.E.F.E.A.T!"
"#02177","Noooooo! How... can... this... be? The king of calamity, defeated?"
,"You really are a legend of Heropolis..."
,"Farewell!"
"#02178","Whoa! Did you see that combo just then!?"
,"When multiple heroes of same color attack at the same time, that's when you get a combo."
,"The trick is to use suits with a high power gauge charge speed."
,"Let's do it, heroes! It's combo time!"
"#02179","Oh no... We got a big nothing..."
,"Huh? What's this written on the back..."
,"""If you collect 10 of these, then..."""
,"Hmmm, the rest is all blurred out, but I wonder what will happen..."
"#02180","We've finally collected 10 booby prizes..."
,"WHOA! We can now spin the special roulette wheel!"
,"Just look at that prize list... You can even get secret suits and special megabots!"
,"Go on, give it your best shot!"
"#02181","You don’t have a character ticket... I did hear you could buy them from the shop, however."
"#02182","You don’t have any friends that you can convince to live here..."
,"Perhaps it would be a good idea to make some products and invite people to the town!"
"#02183","Who do you want to move?"
"#02184","You can enter a <co=0070c0>Friend ID </co>here...  Let's try it!"
"#02185","What's that you've got there? Oh, it's a time capsule."
,"I heard that if you bury one of those in town, it might turn into a valuable item!"
,"Why not try using one? You can find them in the <co=0070c0>Item menu</co>!"
"#02186","Erm... Look, there's a hero that’s been brainwashed by Evilcorp!"
,"Perhaps if we defeat them, we will get a lot of mod points when we finish this mission..."
,"Let's unwash that brain!"
"#02187","You can have 2 battle teams."
,"Tap the arrow at the bottom of the screen to <co=0070c0>modify your battle teams</co>."
,"The team that isn't in battle can then rest in their homes and recover HP based on the houses' recovery power."
,"Make sure you modify your battle team to be the strongest and healthiest it can be before jumping into battle!"
"#02188","Oh..."
,"I opened the time capsule but there's nothing in here..."
,"Maybe we should increase the<co=366092> <co=0070c0>level of the building </co>where we want to bury the capsules..."
,"Or look at the compatibility of our installations... Or increase our tech level..."
"#02189","Whoa, you've taken quite a hit!"
,"If you wait and<co=366092> <co=0070c0>don't attack for a short while</co>, your HP will recover little by little."
,"Heroes living in homes with high recovery power will recover HP faster."
,"If you level up a building, its<co=366092> <co=0070c0>recovery power<co=366092> </co>rises too, you know."
"#02190","Oh look, you've got a baddie's heromorph suit!"
,"Let me have a look at it... Oh well - Hmmm... It's - How about... YES! No... YES!"
,"Although it's completely inferior to our heroes' suits, when you fight a foe wearing the same suit, they will be weakened."
,"It would be good if you won more of these suits from the friend lottery."
,"Just think of how useful they'd be for fighting strong enemies, or even just the small fry!"
"#02191","Whoa! It's getting quite busy around here!"
,"Now's the time to use your strategic genius and switch out your heroes by tapping <co=0070c0>Team<co=366092> </co>on the bottom left of the screen."
"#02192","There's nowhere available for your friend to live..."
,"Shall we send them on their way?"
"#02193","Which building do you want them to live in?"
"#02194","You can now use the Automate function!"
,"On Page 1 you can set farms to grow their own vegetables and fish, and mines to produce ore on their own."
,"If you tap the down arrow, you can automate production of items for sale."
,"I think it would be a  good idea to turn <co=0070c0>OFF</co> the vegetables that are used for Heromorph suit upgrades..."
,"The settings affect all your installations."
,"You can change the settings at any time. Just tap a building or field and go to Automate."
"#02195","Oh look, you can write a review here and get some free coins! I wonder how many..."
,"Whoa! 200 coins!"
,"You should definitely go and write a review, then come back to spend them!"
"#02196","Hisssssssss... Hissssssssssss..."
,"Heh heh heh..."
,"I went out into the forest to enjoy the new year, and a snake fell out of a tree and wrapped itself around me..."

,"Huh?"
,"What do you mean Christmas is already over?"
,"Well there's nothing else I can do..."
,"...But fight!"
"#02205","Oh my..."
,"It's not polite to just burst in and demand a fight like that..."
,"First I must take my hat off, and have a nice cup of tea..."
,"..."
